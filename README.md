### Note:
In all projects, are missing the usual .project, .classpath and .settings files/folder. 
These are generated automatically (on VSCode for example).

To use this project in Eclipse, just import it as a maven project:

File > Import... > Maven > Existing Maven Project

then select the unzipped project (the file pom.xml appears is the Projects subwindow) and hit finish.
